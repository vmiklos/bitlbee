== Tabs

I use the following tabs during the development:

1) bitlbee-skype:

vim, make, etc.

2) bitlbee:

gdb --args ./bitlbee -v -n -D
run

3) skyped:

python skyped.py -n -d

4) irssi

== Tests

The plugin is tested with a mocked IRC client and a mocked skyped. To add a new
test, the following steps are necessary:

1) Add a new -skyped.mock file: just do the test manually, copy&paste the
skyped output and clean it up, so Alice talks to Bob.  You can test the created
mock file by starting skyped with the -m option, and testing it from an IRC
client manually.

2) Add a new -bitlbee.mock file: do the test manually from irssi, and use:

/connect -rawlog rawlog localhost

Then clean up the rawlog: the input lines are parsed as matching patterns, so
boring prefix/suffix text can be left out, non-interesting lines can be
deleted. The output lines still have to be strict IRC commands, as usual.

3) Add the new test to test.py and run it!

// vim: ft=asciidoc
